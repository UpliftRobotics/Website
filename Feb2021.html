        <h1>Meet 3 & 4 Robot Recap</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">These last two meets have been very different for us in terms of robot
                    development than we've dealt with previously. Instead of redesigning everything as we did for the
                    first two meets, we instead worked on optimizing the pre-existing design to maximize performance and
                    reliability. While that doesn't make the changes to the robot itself overly exciting, the
                    performance gains we saw with more driver practice and minor design changes were huge! We finished
                    meet 4 with a high score of 227 and an average of 192. This average shows more reliability than
                    we've ever had before and we plan for that consistency to stay as we alter the robot in the future.
                    These minimal design changes were made with the intent of understanding the most consistent way to
                    accomplish each task before the meet 5 redesign.</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col-5">

        <h2>Intake</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-5 mb-3">
                <img width="100%" class="rounded" style="opacity: 0.9;" src="images/newsletters/feb2021/IMG_4284.jpeg">

            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">The Intake had the most visually striking change between meet 3 and 4. We
                    reduced the number of poly belts down to 1 and added a bar to the front to allow us to intake stacks
                    of rings. In addition to those two changes, we geared the bottom roller to mitigate some of the
                    jamming issues we had previously (watch the video below for more details). While this made the
                    intake perform better, it is still fairly unreliable in performing at its best and is the primary
                    focus around the impending meet 5 redesign. </h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Wobble</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-5">
                <img width="100%" class="rounded" style="opacity: 0.9;" src="images/newsletters/feb2021/IMG_4287.jpeg">
            </div>
            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">The wobble mechanism was redesigned twice between meet 3 and 4 to ensure
                    reliability. The meet 2 design had serious consistency and usability issues that caused us to ditch
                    it entirely. We then moved to the meet 3 design which was mounted on the back of the robot but had
                    to be powered by a motor because it kept burning out servos. The issue with this was that we
                    couldn't set it to a consistent position making it incredibly difficult to use leading to the
                    current meet 4 design. The meet 4 design uses two servos (as pictured) which allows us to set a
                    precise position for the wobble mechanism making it much easier to use. While this does work
                    consistently, the mechanism is fairly unstable and requires a lot of maintenance meaning it will
                    also be redesigned for meet 5. </h4>

        <h2>Transfer</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-5">
                <img width="100%" class="rounded" style="opacity: 0.9;" src="images/newsletters/jan2021/IMG_4197.jpeg">
            </div>
            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">The Transfer has changed the least since meet 2. Although it's had some
                    reliability issues, it's been performing at the level we needed so we never changed it. For meet 5,
                    it will be seeing a pretty drastic redesign to increase both the speed and the reliability as we
                    push for higher scores in future meets. First, we are switching the string on the linear slide to a
                    belt in order to speed up the slides and eliminate the chances of the string coming off or breaking
                    as it has in the past. This is extremely important as, without the transfer, we are incapable of
                    shooting rings. Second, we are switching from the flicker that pushes the rings into the shooter to
                    a linear push mechanism to increase the speed in which we can shoot 3 rings back to back. By pushing
                    the rings
                    into the shooter at a higher velocity, we don't have to wait as long for the wheels to spin back up
                    between each shot motivating us to switch to this faster linear mechanism.</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Shooter</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-5">
                <img width="100%" class="rounded" style="opacity: 0.9;" src="images/newsletters/feb2021/IMG_4285.jpeg">
            </div>
            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">Our shooter has been the most consistent module on the robot all season and
                    it continued to perform that way throughout meet 3 and 4. The only major changes made were to the
                    angle of the shooter and the guide to allow us to shoot more consistently from closer to the goal.
                    In the match videos, you'll notice we shoot from the white line on the field rather than further
                    back as we have previously which saves us a lot of time throughout a match. For meet
                    5, we are redesigning the shooter to only have one wheel instead of two. We've discovered that using
                    two wheels doesn't present any advantages and it puts more stress on the motors because there are
                    two wheels instead of one. In search of more speed as mentioned before, we believe it will allow for
                    less of a pause between shots due to more motor power on the one wheel instead of distributed across
                    two. The fundamentals of the shooter, however, are staying the same and it will visually appear
                    similar to the original.</h4>

                    something without having to redesign it. This design practice will continue to improve throughout
                    the rest of the season and should help us make our designs perform better while using fewer
                    resources. To the left is a video we made summarizing all the meet 4 changes for both the robot and
