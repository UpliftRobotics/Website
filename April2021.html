                    working program that does it autonomously. Not only does this cut the average time we spend on power
                    shots in half, but it also made them more consistent than we were ever able to achieve manually.
                    While there is still some tweaking that needs to be done to get it to work every time, we plan to
                    continue using it and are excited to implement more driver aids like this in the future. After
                    seeing how consistent it was in matches, we are also hoping to implement it in autonomous to earn an
                    extra few points where possible. </h4>

                    them to shift around as they had previously. While this kept the rings in place and worked more
                    consistently than previous designs, it still jammed occasionally although not as severely as it used
                    to. It is, however, still an improvement over the last one and we plan to improve upon it for

                    consistently. By slowing things down a little bit and being more cautious, we were able to score an
                    average of 263 points at this meet which was significantly higher than previous meets although we
                    didn't reach a new high score (the match shown to the left is 294 points). This becomes extremely
                    important as every match counts at these high-level competitions unlike qualifiers where the top 10
                    matches count towards our ranking of the 36 qualifying matches we played this season. Therefore, we
                    are planning on keeping this slightly slower, steadier pace at States to ensure that we average the
                    highest score we possibly can.</h4>
