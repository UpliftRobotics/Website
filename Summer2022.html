While our new robot faced many problems, we were still able to become division finalists with Java the Hutts and Crazy Cat Ladies. We also won the connect award for our consistent community engagement. Although we didn’t qualify for worlds, we learned a lot and had a great time at states. Even though this was the last competition for some of our seniors, we hope to continue to build on what we’ve learned from these competitions for future seasons. Since we won’t have any seniors on the team next season, sustainability and learning will continue to be our main focus next year.

Next season we are planning to engage in events with local schools and the community and continue previous events like Maker Faire and STEM nights.

So far we have uploaded 74 youtube videos with over 17,000 views in total on a variety of topics like SendCutSend, Science experiments, PTC Creo, and coding. Continuing to make these videos allows us to teach others important concepts as well as expand our knowledge, as well as increasing the quality of these videos with experience. We will also continue to post on other social media platforms.

Going forward, we hope that this status will improve our sponsorship program, but we are still searching for sponsors and grants, especially since we are a relatively new FTC team. Since building robots and competing is not cheap, we are hoping our sponsorship program will expand with help from our non profit status. If you know a company that is willing to support our team, we would be more than happy to get in contact with them.

We also wanted to make sure our funding was sustainable. To accomplish this, we formed a 501c3 for our team. Forming a 501c3 allowed members of our team to learn more about running businesses as well as making the donation process much easier for sponsors. We also made our team sustainable by creating team leadership roles. We appointed co-leads, hardware leads, and software leads.

                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">This year, we heavily focused on helping the community. We held 7 Hololens giveaways where we gave Hololenses to local school STEM programs as well as through raffles at competitions. We also mentored 4 FLL teams with a bid to regionals from Jackson Heights Middle School and Seminole Science Charter, allowing us to share our personal experiences and lessons. This also improved our sustainability since some members from those teams may end up joining our team in future seasons. We were also able to get many new industry mentors through personal connections, allowing us to introduce FIRST to industry professionals and implement professional techniques on our team.
