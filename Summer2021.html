                    year, the entire event was held virtually with all judging held over Zoom and all robot matches
                    recorded online. It was, however, just as competitive as it’s ever been with several younger teams
                    (including us) working hard to get to the top. With a large focus on judging and portfolio in
                    addition to AP exams, the robot itself changed very little. Lucky for us, that focus on judging paid
                    off earning us the top overall award at the State Competition and recognition from all of the
                    Florida FIRST community. </h3>

        <h1>2 Inspire Award Wins in a Rookie Season - Virtually Unheard Of</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">If you’ve been watching our work this season, you know that we set out to
                    make an impact and shake things up in the Florida competition field. After winning 1st place
                    Inspire, the top overall award at the Space Coast League Championship, and now another one at
                    States, we believe we have accomplished that goal. We are extremely grateful to be the first rookie
                    team to win either of those awards in the better part of 10 years and can’t thank our supporters
                    enough. Without our sponsors, mentors, families, and friends, we wouldn’t have access to the tools
                    we needed to make all of this possible. As a student-run team this year, we learned that even with
                    the right tools, it’s our hard work that allows us to accomplish our goals. Without the dedication
                    and forward thinking that our members showed this year, we wouldn’t be where we are today. While for
                    many of our veteran members this has been their most successful season on record, we can all
                    comfortably say that we’ve learned more this season than any other which is an incredible thing in
                    itself. Our goal next year is to continue that theme of learning overall and success as a
                    consequence.</h4>

                <h4>Due to a huge amount of requests for our portfolio immediately after the state competition, we
                    released it publicly just as we did for the League Championship. While we know that this lessens our
                    competitive advantage for the upcoming season, we believe it will help meet our goal of progressing
                    the FIRST community. If we introduce new ideas that are proven successful, other teams will begin to
                    use them and create their own ideas. As nice as being ahead is, there's something exciting about
                    progressive competition too.</h4>
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">In regards to outreach plans for next season, the programs we started this
                    year will remain in place and continue to grow this coming season. All of the YouTube series are
                    expected to be posting content in the coming weeks with higher quality videos than we've ever
                    produced previously in addition to our other previous programs making a return. With COVID
                    restrictions slowly lifting for events and within the schools, we hope to have more in person
                    outreach this year as well attending elementary school STEM Nights and events like Maker Fair. We
                    also received a donation of Hololenses from Mr.Treibitz (Thank you!) that are going to be used for a
                    variety of different outreach programs in this coming season.</h4>

                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">Just like last season, we are virtually back to square one in terms of
                    funding. Although the mutual sponsorship program will continue and expand, we are starting fresh in
                    terms of finding grants and monetary sponsors. That's not unusual for an FTC team especially one as
                    young as us but we still need all the help we can get. If you or anyone you know works for a company
                    that would be willing to support us, we'd be more than happy to get in contact and ask for their
                    support. There's never enough money in robotics so we are doing everything and anything we can to
                    find more for this season. Especially with in person competitions and other events that are starting
                    back up this season is going to be more expensive than the last so we are preparing for it the best
                    we can.</h4>

                    for and we have all of you to thank for that. To the parents, we thank you for giving us rides and
                    talking through what we did at robotics even if we didn't want to. To the mentors, we thank you for
                    being that extra set of eyes to help us break through roadblocks and introduce new concepts to the
                    team. To the sponsors, we thank you for backing our team and believing in us even when we didn't
                    have a plan or know exactly what the season was going to look like. And finally, to the coaches, we
                    thank you for welcoming us into your home at all hours of the night, doing everything you could to
                    make this team a fun and exciting place to be, and, most importantly, giving us all a laugh when we
                    most needed it. This has been a phenomenal season and we really couldn't have asked for anything
                    more than we received. </h4>

                    prepared to carry the success we had this season into the next and build further upon it to "uplift"
                    the people around us. We hope that you find success wherever life takes you and that you'll be
                    awaiting phone calls for your help whenever we need it ;)</h4>

                    we were this past season, while making the environment as fun as it can possibly be. With in person
                    competitions and meetings, we are going to form connections as a team we never got to make before
                    and welcoming new members into the family is going to be as exciting as ever. There's still so much
                    for us to do and so much room for us to grow and we can't wait to discover and show what we are
                    capable of. See you next Season!</h4>
