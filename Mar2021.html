                    judging oriented as we switch gears from robot progression to preparing for the league competition.

            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">Since last meet, the robot has been fully stripped down and rebuilt for the
                    3rd time this season. This new design is set up to be a platform for the rest of the season oriented
                    around speed and consistency. Although it was successful in the speed portion as you'll see later, we
                    have a long way to go with consistency as we do with any new design which will be the main focus for
                    the rest of the season. </h4>

            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">The most substantial improvement in robot performance can be attributed to
                    the intake. As we hoped, it provided consistency in performance that the previous design was
                    lacking. We accomplished this by adding a series of rollers that widened the reach of the intake.
                    These rollers allowed us to pick up rings by scraping them along the ground instead of having to
                    force them inside the robot by ramming in to walls. We also added belts on the side of the intake
                    that shift rings into the center (as demonstrated in the video) allowing us to intake rings from
                    virtually anywhere along the front of the robot rather than the 6-inch space we had previously.
                    Overall, the intake has transformed our cycle times cutting about 3 seconds off of the previous 12
                    seconds by itself. Due to the success of the module, we don't have many planned changes for it other
                    than some basic structural changes to the front roller to make it more rigid. </h4>

        <h2>Shooter</h2>
        <div class="row">

            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">Although the changes made to the shooter ultimately simplified it, it's
                    performing drastically better than it did previously. As shown in the video, the arc the rings take
                    when shot is straighter and more consistent than previous modules. This new arc makes both our
                    software team and driver's life much easier as they can now point the robot at the goal and shoot
                    rather than having to consider whether or not the shot may bank and any other strange ways the rings
                    may behave. It also gets up to its target speed faster and more consistently due to having two
                    motors on one wheel. All of these improvements have made the shooter near perfection and we don't
                    have many improvements in mind for the future.</h4>

            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">One of the biggest reliability issues we had with the previous robot was the
                    string that pulled the transfer up either coming off the spool or snapping. To mitigate this issue,
                    we went from a string to a belt drive making the module more difficult to break from basic usage. Additionally, we changed from a flicker to a linear push mechanism due to space
                    constraints and for speed. While we haven't seen a huge performance benefit out of it yet, we should
                    see a pretty substantial speed increase with more optimization. This module as a whole has likely
                    the most revisions to come as we still have a lot of optimization to do all around. We've had issues
                    with rings jamming when coming in from the intake which has caused nearly all performance benefits
                    to vanish. Therefore, we are testing all sorts of different configurations for meet 6.</h4>

            <div class="col-7 mb-1">
                <h4 class="text-left pt-3">We are proud to say that our wobble mechanism is now the most over-engineered
                    module on the robot! The main reason for the full redesign of this module was to allow for a super-wide grabbing mechanism that has nearly 5 inches of range making the drivers' lives easier. The new
                    geometry of the arm also folds into the robot better and was designed specifically for dropping the
                    wobble over the field wall which is something we had issues with in the past. Although this module
                    was the least in need of a redesign, the new version came out really well and the benefits it
                    provides are nice to have.</h4>

                    auto. We were able to raise our maximum autonomous score from 83 to 107 points due to these new
                    modules behaving in a more predictable manner which has been a huge help in increasing our overall
                    scores. In the future, we are working on increasing the autonomous score but more importantly
                    focussing on getting those high scores consistently and trying to find ways that we can enhance our
                    drivers' abilities by automating their tasks.</h4>

                    rest of the season and we are excited to see just how far we can push this design. While this robot
                    did have issues as we'd expect with any first iteration design, it performed better than many of us
                    expected and we are happy with what worked well and what didn't. The platform really does show a lot
                    of potential and pushing it to its limits, breaking it, and fixing it is going to be a fun way to
                    finish off this robot for the year.</h4>

                    meet 6, we are aiming to see scores like this consistently with more driver practice and slight
                    tweaks to the robot. With this being a first iteration design, our consistency wasn't spectacular with an
                    average of 222 for the meet but we are fairly confident that we can reach a near 300 point average for
                    meet 6. Check out the match video!</h4>
